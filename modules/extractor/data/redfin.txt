Your Opt Out Preference Signal is Honored
## Cookie Settings
The California Consumer Privacy Act 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act 2020 (“CCPA”) permits California residents, or their authorized agents, to opt out of the “sale” and "sharing" of their personal information to third parties. The CCPA defines the terms “sale” and "share" broadly, which may mean they include using third-party advertising and analytics tools such as cookies. We never sell personal information to third parties for money. When you visit this website, we and our partners may collect certain information about you, your devices, and your behavior, and “sell” or "share" this information to third parties to provide you with certain advertising on this site and across the web tailored to you and your interests. Clicking on the "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" button below will opt you out of the “sale” and "sharing" of your personal information, as defined by the CCPA, of certain advertising of our products and services on this and other sites. If you opt out on this website, your choice will not apply to any other Redfin site, and you will need to separately opt-out on those sites. Similarly, your opt out will only apply to the device on which you opt out, and only for so long as you maintain cookies on the device. Therefore, you must opt out on each device separately (or, if you clear cookies, on the same device) when you visit our website. If you choose to opt out of the “sale” or "sharing" of your personal information, you may continue to see advertising, such as ads by us or our partners related to you and your interests, including, for example, ads that do not involve the “sale” or "sharing" of personal information. You or your authorized agent may also have other choices and tools that allow you to control certain data collection activities.
